# Data Structures

This repository is sort of a library that contains multiple implementations of different data structures.
These implementations are generic, capable of storing any data type, as long it's a pointer.

The data structures you may find here are:
- Common data structures
    - Arrays
    - Stacks
    - Queues
- Lists
    - Single Linked List
    - Double Linked List
- Heaps
    - Min Heap
    - Max Heap
- Tries
- Tuples
- Sets
- Dictionaries
    - Hash Tables
- Trees
    - Binary Search Trees
    - AVL Trees
    - Red and Black Trees
    - N-Ary Trees
- Graphs

## Algoritms

There is also a section that presents various sorting and searching algorithms, also generic:
- Sorts
    - Bubble Sort
    - Selection Sort
    - Insertion Sort
    - Quick Sort
    - Merge Sort
    - Heap Sort
- Search
    - Linear Seach
    - Binary

This repository is still in (early) development.
