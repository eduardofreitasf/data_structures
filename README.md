# Data Structures

This repository is sort of a library that contains multiple implementations of different data structures.
These implementations are generic, capable of storing any data type, as long it's a pointer.

In each function provided, there is also the complexity of that operation.

The data structures you may find here are:
- Common data structures
    - Arrays
    - Stacks
    - Queues
        - Single Ended Queue
        - Double Ended Queue
        - Circular Queue
- Lists
    - Linked List
    - Double Linked List
- Heaps
    - Min/Max Heap
- Tuples
- Sets
    - Set
    - Multi Sets
- Dictionaries
    - Dictionary
    - Hash Tables
        - Closed Adressing
        - Open Adressing
        - Cuckoo Hashing
        - Hopscotch Hashing
    - Tries (Prefix Trees)
- Trees
    - Binary Search Trees
    - AVL Trees
    - Red and Black Trees
    - N-Ary Trees
    - B+ Trees
- Graphs

## Algorithms

There is also a section that presents various sorting and searching algorithms, also generic:
- Sorts
    - Bubble Sort
    - Selection Sort
    - Insertion Sort
    - Quick Sort
    - Merge Sort
    - Heap Sort
    - Tim Sort
    - Counting Sort
    - Radix Sort
    - Stalin Sort
    - Bogo Sort

- Search
    - Linear Seach
    - Binary Search
    - Jump Search

This repository is still in (early) development.
