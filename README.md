# Data Structures

## Description

This project is meant to explore multiple data structres, and parsing techniques, in a usefull way.

The program receives a .csv file, containing thousands of lines. The program will parse each line, storing it in a certain entity.
After this process is done, theses entities shall be stored in a hash table, in which slot of the table will be a data stucture, selected by the user in first hand. By doing so, the collisons problem will be solved, by only needing to go through a rather small data structure. The hash table will have a dinamic size, when the number of elements reachs a certain limit, the program rehashes the table, assuring that each slot of the table contains a small data structure.
