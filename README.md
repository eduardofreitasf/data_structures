# Data Structures

This repository is sort of a library that contains multiple implementations of different data structures.
These implementations are generic, capable of storing any data type, as long it's a **pointer**.

In each function provided, there is also the **complexity** of that operation.

:warning: **WARNING**:
This repository is still in (**early**) development.

The **data structures** you may find here are:

    - Arrays
    - Stacks
    - Queues
