# Data Structures

This repository is sort of a library that contains multiple implementations of different data structures.
These implementations are generic, capable of storing any data type, as long it's a **pointer**.

In each function provided, there is also the **complexity** of that operation.

**WARNING**:
This repository is still in (**early**) development.

The **data structures** you may find here are:
- Common data structures
    - Arrays
    - Stacks
    - Queues
        - Single Ended Queue
        - Double Ended Queue
        - Circular Queue
- Lists
    - Linked List
    - Double Linked List
- Heaps
    - Min/Max Heap
    - Fibonacci Heap
    - Binomial Queue
    - Leftist Heap
    - Skew Heap
- Tuples
