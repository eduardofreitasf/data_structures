# Lists

The implemented lists are:
- **Single Linked List**
- **Double Linked List**

## Single Linked List

The [Linked List](/lists/linked_list/) implementation provides the user with the following operations: appending, preppending, ordered insertion, removal, sorting, cloning, reversal, concatenation and some others.

The **sorting** algorithm used is [Merge Sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merge_sort), but there are (**will be**) other sorting algorithms implemented.

This implementation is generic, you are able to store any data type, as long it's a pointer.

## Double Linked List
