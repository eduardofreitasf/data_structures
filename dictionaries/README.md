# Dictionaries

The following data stuctrues are implemented:
- Dictionary (Tree)
- Hash Tables
- Prefix Trees

A [Dictionary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associative_array) is a data structure that stores key value pairs, in which the key is used to acess the value. This concept allows to create very efficient data structures such as the present bellow.

:warning: For **simplicity**, the keys used in these implementations are **strings**.

:warning: **to be made** :warning:

## Hash Tables

A [Hash Table](/dictionaries/hash_tables/) is a dictionary that uses a hash function to map keys.
The hash function determines the position in which the key hashs, this idea provides a complexity of O(1) to acess a value.

I implemented multiple types of hash tables, such as:
- Closed Adressing
- Open Adressing

### Hash Functions

In this litle section you can find some implementions of [hash functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_function), such as:
- FNV
- **add more**

## Prefix Trees
